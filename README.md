## How to run

More recent versions of PHP come with a built-in web server which is ideal for local development. To use this, open a terminal or console and go into the www folder. There, run this command:

`php -S localhost:8080`

You can now see your system up and running when you go to http://localhost:8080/ in your web browser.
