## How to run

More recent versions of PHP come with a built-in web server which is ideal for local development. To use this, open a terminal or console and go into the www folder. There, run this command:

`php -S localhost:8080`

You can now see your system up and running when you go to http://localhost:8080/ in your web browser.

* AC issues
* Is your car overheating while idling? There’s a good chance that something is wrong with your cooling fan. On the front of your radiator is an electric fan designed to push air to the radiator to improve its engine cooling ability. If the fan isn’t working properly, then the radiator can’t effectively cool your engine, especially on a hot summer day. Not to worry, fixing a cooling fan is typically inexpensive.
