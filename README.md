## How to run

More recent versions of PHP come with a built-in web server which is ideal for local development. To use this, open a terminal or console and go into the www folder. There, run this command:

`php -S localhost:8080`

You can now see your system up and running when you go to http://localhost:8080/ in your web browser.


### TO DO
* Add rule for battery
* Car stalls
* worn down tires: https://autoairandheatingrepair.com/2018/08/do-bad-road-wear-tires-faster/
* coolant at high speeds: https://www.quora.com/What-causes-overheating-in-a-car-especially-when-speed-exceeds-120km-hour-or-when-the-a-c-is-on
* Well this is probably more common on older cars on hot environments. Let's use an example, you’re driving up a long and steep incline, it’s 100 degrees out. You have your A/C on obviously. So now you have outside heat, a steep incline and the AC all putting strain on the engine Creating additional heat. This is even worse if you are hauling anything or have a full car of people. The radiator and it's fan can't keep up causing the car to over heat.

* AC issues
* Is your car overheating while idling? There’s a good chance that something is wrong with your cooling fan. On the front of your radiator is an electric fan designed to push air to the radiator to improve its engine cooling ability. If the fan isn’t working properly, then the radiator can’t effectively cool your engine, especially on a hot summer day. Not to worry, fixing a cooling fan is typically inexpensive.
