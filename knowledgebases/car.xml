	<title>Which program should I enter?</title>
	<description>This is an example to show you some of the features of the inference engine.</description>

	<!-- 
	The goal of our program is to give one advice: what is wrong with your car.

	Note the goal name parameter: this is the name of the fact that the solver will try to deduce. Each answer has a value which that fact can have.

	The value $undefined is assigned to a fact if the solver cannot find any way to deduce a value for the fact, i.e. there are no rules (left) that are applicable nor any questions.

	The last answer has no value parameter. This one will match anything that is not matched by any of the previous answers. In the text associated with that answer the variable $program is used. You can use the fact name with $ in front of it in pretty much any context to get the value of that fact. Here it is replaced with whatever the value of the fact program is.

	Note that $undefined is also a variable, as it should be the value of the fact 'undefined' in the knowledge base: that is what we try to match.

	If none of the answer-clauses match, and there is no fallback answer-clause without a value, the system won't know what to print and not show the goal at all. You can use this to make an advisor like system by making all possible advises seperate goals and only providing an answer for when that goal is 'yes' or 'true' or whatever value you conceive for a certain advice being applicable.

	<goal name="identified_problem">
		<answer value="The wheels are blocked">Wheels.</answer>
		<answer value="CS">Computing Science</answer>
		<answer value="Phi">Philosophy</answer>
		<answer value="Psy">Psychology</answer>
		<answer value="$undefined">I don't know what you should do, sorryâ€¦</answer>
		<answer>Something else, namely $program.</answer>
	</goal>

	<!--
	These rule cases are pretty self explaining. The description is more for the programmer than for the user of the QA system: it is only displayed in the debug and analyse views. However, it is really useful to determine which rule is misbehaving and what it should do instead.

	You can have multiple <fact>-clauses in your <then>-clause, but it can only be <fact>-clauses. You can not add rules or questions dynamically in this way.

	If you have multiple tests in your <if>-clause, you should immediately start with an <and> or <or>-clause. And of course you can combine them. The <fact>-clauses test whether a fact with that name has the value.

	In the <fact> clauses you can use variables for both the name argument and the value. It will then use the value of that fact you are referring to as if it has been there instead. If that fact you use as a variable is not yet derived, the solver will do that for you.
